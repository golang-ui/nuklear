Nuklear Activity
================

This android app is built using [android-go](http://github.com/xlab/android-go) framework,
and the GUI is done via [nuklear](http://github.com/golang-ui/nuklear) that uses Android NDK as a backend.
It manages an OpenGL ES 2.0 or 3.0 context via EGL to draw stuff on the screen and gets touch input from the sensors.

### Prerequisites

There is no additional prerequisites, the project fully inherits the same
structure as the Android [example] app provides, make sure you were able to run it
first. Just to make sure that everything works smoothly for your OS, environment
setup and the device itself.
